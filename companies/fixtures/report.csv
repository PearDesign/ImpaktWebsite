MAN avoided a fine, which could be up to EUR 1.2 billion, through the leniency notice. The cartel began in 1997 in Belgium and senior-level managers met regularly at trade fairs to coordinate the prices at “gross list” level until 2004. From 2004 to 2011, mid-level managers met at companies’ German subsidiaries and exchanged information electronically. Three major issues were discussed: prices at gross list level, timing for the introduction of emission technologies from Euro III through to current Euro VI standards, and passing on the costs for emissions technologies to customers. The EC started unannounced inspections following MAN’s report and it officially announced an investigation in January 2011. The concerned companies’ trucks account for 9 out of 10 medium and heavy trucks in Europe. Accordingly, the biggest truck maker, Daimler, received the highest fine (EUR 1 billion) in July 2016, followed by DAF (EUR 752 million), Volvo (EUR 670 mn) and Iveco (EUR 495 mn). Volvo set aside EUR 650 million for fines.

Apple Inc,1007903183,Apple Inc,,,,,"Apple has been facing numerous allegations of poor labour conditions in its supply chain, including excessive working hours, child labour, abuse of student interns, health risks, and unpaid wages. Although Apple announced that it would investigate and take corrective actions, NGOs such as China Labour Watch (CLW) claim that similar violations continue to occur. Allegations related to supply chain labour conditions are not uncommon in the sector and Apple has implemented certain progressive measures relative to its peers, including disclosing its supplier list and publishing an annual supplier progress report since 2012. However, despite Apple’s social supply chain standards and auditing system, scrutiny continues to draw focus to the challenge of effective and comprehensive implementation to ensure prevention of recurrent supply chain labour rights violation incidents.Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM), Amnesty International and CLW have continued to release reports that allege labour standard violations at Apple suppliers. For example, in September 2017, SACOM disclosed in a report that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, violated several labor laws at one of its factories in China. The report claimed that university students employed as interns were used as production line workers.","Apple has faced multiple allegations, lawsuits, and investigations focused on anti-competitive practices related to its e-book, music and mobile business segments. The company's anti-competitive exposure has a global profile with investigations and lawsuits spanning France, US, China and South Korea, In February 2014, the Second Court of Appeals in the US decided that Apple broke antitrust laws in e-book deals, and ordered Apple to pay consumers USD 450 million in damages, which Apple appealed unsuccessfully. In April 2016, France's competition, consumer and fraud agency, DGCCRF, filed a lawsuit against Apple claiming the company set up contracts with mobile carriers that violate French anti-competitive laws. DGCCRF is seeking penalties of EUR 48.5 million (USD 55.2 million). In June 2016, the South Korean Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was investigating Apple's contracts with local telecommunications providers. As part of this investigation, the FTC raided the company's offices in November 2017.

The EC began investigating Apple in 2014 regarding the corporate taxation agreement granted by Ireland in 1991 and 2007, and was terminated in 2015. The tax agreement between the parties was determined to violate the EU’s state aid rules, since it provided a competitive advantage to the company. The tax ruling permitted Apple to pay substantially less than the standard corporate tax rate of 12.5% in Ireland. In some years, Apple’s effective tax rate was just 0.05%. Apple recorded all sales outside of the Americas through the company’s fully-owned Irish registered units. Based on the tax agreement, the majority of profits were allocated to the units’ headquarters, where profits were untaxed.

The EC’s ruling is exceptional, in terms of the scale of the repayment, the decision to collect back taxes for a period of 10 years, and the precedence set for other jurisdictions to investigate Apple's tax practices. Investigations of other multi-national corporations by the EC on state aid and taxation practices have resulted in repayments in the hundreds of millions of dollars; however, in this case the repayment is valued at USD 14.5 billion plus interest, the highest so far. Apple faces further legal and regulatory scrutiny by the EU and other jurisdictions where it operates, raising the possibility of higher tax rates in the coming years. Our rating also reflects the perceived inadequacy of the company’s existing tax management system. Apple failed to meet the January 2017 deadline to pay the tax penalty although in December 2017 it agreed to send payments to the Irish government starting in 2018.

While intellectual property incidents are not uncommon in the industry and Apple's market prominence may be a driver for patent litigation, the recurrence of associated incidents suggests inadequate mitigation by the company. Furthermore, in the event that Apple receives an unfavorable ruling for a key patent used in its devices, the company could face injunctions and be unable to sell its products in certain markets.","Apple continues to face allegations of patent infringement in the form of litigation and regulatory investigations. It has faced multiple unfavourable judgments with hundreds of millions of dollars being awarded to plaintiffs. In October 2015, a U.S. court ruled against Apple for infringing a processor efficiency improvement patent by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) and awarded WARF USD 234 million. Apple appealed the verdict although it was dismissed. Apple was also ordered to pay USD 507 million in total damages to WARF in July 2017 for infringing on microchip patents. Immersion Corporation, Nokia, Qualcomm and Aqua Connect have all either filed lawsuits alleging patent infringement or complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and the ITC has initiated investigations based on these complaints. Immersion alleges Apple infringed three of its haptic feedback system patents. A US jury in Texas ruled against Apple in April 2018 and ordered it to pay USD 502.6 million to VirnetX for infringement of VPN related patents. This is the fourth time that a court or jury has ruled against Apple for infringing on VirnetX patents, which was initially filed in 2010.",2,,,3,"Sustainalytics assesses this controversy as a Category 3 due to the fact that the alleged labour rights violations were widespread among Apple's suppliers in Asia and beyond, and took place over a number of years. Similar violations are not uncommon in the sector, but the coverage and scrutiny of Apple’s violations, in part due to its market prominence, is in-depth and frequent contributing to significant reputational risks.","Apple has been facing numerous allegations of poor labour conditions in its supply chain, including excessive working hours, child labour, abuse of student interns, health risks, and unpaid wages.

For example, the leak of Apple's iOS source code through a 3rd party further signals risks around the security of its mobile operating system. There is growing scrutiny of how companies protect and secure user data with upcoming regulations such as the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that can impose significant penalties in the event of a breach. While Apple has displayed positive management in certain areas particularly with respect to law enforcement requests, the recurrence of privacy breaches suggests that certain gaps remain.","Apple has repeatedly been at the center of several accusations related to data privacy breaches. The company has faced lawsuits regarding the collection of geographical data from customers' devices without their consent. Apple's iCloud service has also been compromised with a high profile breach of photos from celebrities that brought increased scrutiny to its data security approach in 2014. Following the breach, the company implemented two factor authentication, which is considered much more secure than a traditional password approach. Incidents also include employees of Apple affiliated distributors selling user information obtained from an internal system, signaling that its supply chain controls and policies with respect to data privacy may have gaps. In March 2018, Apple’s Chinese unit opened an investigation into alleged data security practices and threats conducted by its technology support employees after a customer claimed that an Apple employee harassed him and threatened to publish his personal information stored on iCloud.",3,"Sustainalytics assesses this controversy as Category 3 due to the significant number of customer complaints regarding the quality of certain product lines as well as recalls, investigations and lawsuits related to Apple's repair and warranty services. The company's acknowledgment that it intentionally slowed down older iPhones to prevent them from shutting down increases its exposure to action from regulators and consumers as these stakeholders may explore punitive action and seek redress. While Quality and Safety issues are commonplace in the industry, the recurrence of these incidents and in certain cases, Apple's inadequate mitigation, contributes to ongoing reputational, legal and regulatory risks.","Apple has faced several issues related to the quality of its products as well as its approach to customer rights. The company has been investigated in multiple jurisdictions with respect to customer rights as they pertain to warranty and repairs. Since December 2015, the South Korean Fair Trade Commission has been investigating Apple's commercial relationship with local phone repair companies after complaints that customer rights may have been violated. In April 2017, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) filed a lawsuit against Apple for disabling devices that were serviced by third parties and conducted a sting operation that found Apple employees misleading customers on their right to repairs. Apple acknowledged in December 2017 that it slowed down multiple iPhone models to prevent the devices from shutting down. Following Apple's statement, proposed class action lawsuits were filed in the US and South Korea. In addition, French environmental group Halte l'Obsolescence Programme (HOP) filed a criminal complaint with the Paris prosecutor’s office in light of Apple's confirmation citing French law that criminalizes planned obsolescence.

BMW Group,1008582880,BMW Group,,,"In December 2016, the European network Transport and Environment (T&E) released its annual “Mind the Gap” report, highlighting the growing discrepancy between fuel economy and CO2 emissions values achieved in laboratory tests and those registered in real world driving conditions. In recent years, automakers have been under mounting scrutiny for their malpractice in manipulating emission test results and for possibly employing illegal defeat devices to cheat and pass such tests. Excessively low and unrepresentative results are achieved by exploiting so called “test flexibilities” and loopholes in regulation, which effectively manipulate and alter emission values registered in real world. According to T&E, the industry gap (difference between official laboratory test results and real world car performance) has jumped from 9% in 2001 to over 42% in 2015, and is projected to reach 50% before 2020. The report singled out BMW as one of the companies with the largest and fastest widening gap, standing at almost 45% and falling short of the EU 2015 targets. At the same time, it also noted that BMW delivered on the road more than half of the improvements claimed, a higher percentage than its industry peers. Previously, in the wake of the Dieselgate scandal in September 2015, BMW was also targeted by reports revealing higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from its diesel engines.",,,"BMW is one of five major German carmakers facing scrutiny for its alleged involvement in a cartel since the mid-1990s that possibly laid the foundation for “Dieselgate”. According to a report published by German magazine, Der Spiegel in July 2017, the companies colluded to coordinate actions curbing competition. The report states that around 200 employees in 60 industry committees discussed vehicle development, components, petrol and diesel engines, suppliers, and, notably, the AdBlue system of Selective Catalyst Reduction for exhaust diesel emission treatment. Diesel engines for passenger cars became popular among German carmakers in the late 1990s. The AdBlue technology was developed to clean up diesel emissions. According to the magazine, the carmakers agreed to install smaller tanks than necessary to save up to EUR 80 (USD 93) per vehicle, and to programme vehicles’ emission controls to ration the chemical solution, except when the software detected that an official test was underway. It remains unclear how the alleged collusion was discovered. On July 22, the European Commission (EC) stated that it is currently assessing the information that it received on the cartel. In October 2017, BMW’s Munich office was raided by EU antitrust officials, but no formal charges were made.",,,,,0,,,0,,,2,,,1,,,4,"Our Category 4 rating for BMW stems primarily from the high risks connected to the alleged involvement in a long-held cartel scheme. The company risks considerable financial penalties and faces high regulatory, legal and reputational risks. Under EU rules, the companies risk maximum penalties of up to EUR 40 billion (USD 48 billion) combined, EUR 9 bn of which would be for BMW should the illegal cartel activities be confirmed. Business risks are also anticipated, which may challenge the viability and contribute to the decline of diesel technology, which retains considerable importance in BMW’s portfolio and represents a significant part of its sales. Customer backlash and stricter regulation are expected, thus posing what could be significant challenges for the company to potentially adapt its business model over the medium to long term. A judicial ruling is not provided yet, but the cartel could constitute one of the biggest corporate collusion in the industry, considering the severe detrimental effects on market competition, the impact on industry peers and millions of customers, as well as its role in undermining national and international public policy and ultimately impacting public health and the environment. Despite BMW’s initiatives to manage and mitigate the implications, we note concerns in terms of effectiveness of current compliance systems, past track record and delays in implementing corrective actions effectively.","BMW is one of five major German carmakers facing scrutiny for its alleged involvement in a cartel since the mid-1990s that possibly laid the foundation for “Dieselgate”.

It remains unclear how the alleged collusion was discovered. On July 22, the European Commission (EC) stated that it is currently assessing the information that it received on the cartel.

In April 2015, authorities in Tamil Nadu revoked the permit initially granted to the company to develop its new bottling plant, after locals protested against the construction. Mor notable incidents are related to water withdrawals in Mehdiganj, Uttar Pradesh. According to a local NGO, the Indian Central Groundwater Board, Coca-Cola's operations have resulted in the community being deprived of water, raising concerns among community members.

Enbridge was fined USD 3.7 million, and the total clean-up costs have surpassed USD 1.2 billion. Clean-up concluded in December 2014 and the company has implemented significant improvements to its pipeline management systems that, in theory, should considerably reduce the risk of a new major spill. In March 2015, Enbridge reached a settlement with the Michigan Attorney General and the Department of Environmental Quality regarding the spill, and agreed to pay an additional USD 75 million to finalise ongoing cleanup projects. In July 2016, the company reached a USD 177 million agreement with the Department of Justice involving fines and safety improvements related to the 2010 spills.

Opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline is exceptional, with over 10,000 protesters on the site at times and hundreds of arrests.  ETP’s move to begin construction on the alleged site of cultural significance may have destroyed historical artifacts, and the use of dogs and pepper spray has served to further galvanize opposition.  Hundreds of native tribes from across the US have submitted letters of support, and many have traveled to the protest site.  The protests have garnered significant media attention, and the companies associated with the pipeline face significant reputational risks, and likely also delays, which could result in costs to all of the project owners. Enbridge is the second largest shareholder in the project. However, Enbridge, which has an indigenous rights policy, has shown attempts to engage with ETP to reconcile the controversy surrounding the DAPL. The company’s own projects in Canada have also faced major opposition from aboriginal groups.  Enbridge’s proposed Northern Gateway project has now effectively been blocked, primarily due to opposition from aboriginal groups along the route.  Though the Line 9 reversal project is already operational, the company faces legal risks due to the upcoming Supreme court case about the pipeline.","Enbridge holds a 27.6% stake in the Bakken Pipeline System, which includes the highly controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.

In addition, MTN faces repeated investigations into operational decisions across its markets.

Shares were also temporarily suspended. The proposed fine was reported by the media to be exorbitant and driven by falling Nigerian oil revenues. After months of negotiation, MTN and the Nigerian government settled at a final USD 1.7 bn fine in June 2016. Nigeria is MTN’s largest market and the fine negatively impacted its share price.

The central bank directed Standard Chartered Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Diamond Bank and Citi Bank to stop dividend payouts for MTN. A senate committee ruled that MTN did not illegal repatriate the funds in November 2017, finding no proof of collusion with foreign exchange laws; this substantially reduces risks in Nigeria.

The significant environmental and economic damage for farmers caught the regulatory attention from different US states.

The company faces significant reputational risks due to its ongoing involvement in such projects, and may also incur in adverse operational impacts.","Siemens has faced strong criticism regarding its involvement in controversial hydroelectric projects in Honduras and Brazil. In 2013, its 35% owned joint venture, Voith Hydro, was contracted to supply turbines for the Agua Zarca dam construction in Honduras. The project has received strong opposition from the local communities as the construction will reportedly desiccate the river Gualcarque which is a major source of water and food to the community. The protests have turned violent after the Honduras military shot protesters in July 2013, killing the leader of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), Tomas Garcia. This follows numerous human rights violations including detention of activists, house inspections, and death threats. As a response to the ongoing violence, in March 2016, Finnfund and FMO suspended their funding of the dam. In May 2016, Voith Hydro suspended its deliveries for the project. Siemens also supplied power generation equipment to the Belo Monte Dam in Brazil. The dam is considered a threat to the survival of indigenous people who risk displacement. In March 2013, sex slavery and forced prostitution of children within the dam's construction camp generated media reaction and official investigations regarding human trafficking and slave labour.

The company’s equipment may be used in the development of new power plants in the disputed region of Crimea, which would strengthen its separation from Ukraine, facilitate the normalization of the illegal annexation and thus contribute to destabilize the territorial integrity of Ukraine. As of September 2017, there is no official ruling on whether Siemens deliberately circumvented export regulations and illegally delivered the equipment to the disputed area of Crimea. However, the case signals potential important shortcomings on the part of the company in terms of appropriate selection of business partners as well as risk assessments, due diligence and compliance processes. In fact, since 2014 the EU adopted restrictive measures against a number of Russian individuals, including Sergei Chemezov, who chairs the Russian state-controlled company Rostec. The reason for the restrictions was that Rostec’s subsidiary Technopromexport, with which Siemens signed the contract to supply the turbines in 2015, planned to build energy plants in Crimea. The case has resulted in significant negative reputational exposure, media and political attention, and ongoing legal risks, while the company may suffer financial damage from loss of sales.","Siemens is involved in a significant controversy related to alleged violation of EU sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 following its annexation of Crimea. Reportedly, in July 2015 Siemens signed contracts to deliver four gas turbines to Technopromexport, a Rostec subsidiary, for two new power plants which would be built in Crimea. After coming under scrutiny in August 2016, Siemens stated that the equipment was intended to be used in plants in the Taman peninsula in South Russia, which is separated from Crimea by a strait, and not in the disputed region of Crimea. The company rejected media accusations that this would be only a formality to circumvent the restrictions. In July 2017, the case reignited as reports claimed that Russia delivered the Siemens turbines to Crimea, and the company faced new allegations of breaching sanctions. The case attracted scrutiny from the German and Russian governments, thus also acquiring a political connotation. Siemens stated it was exiting its Russian power-plant joint venture Interautomatika amid the controversy, and also announced an internal investigation as well as legal actions against Technopromexport.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), in a programme in May 2015, revealed widespread and routine abuses of migrant workers in Australia, including illegal and low pay, assault and harassment. Workers from Asia and Europe were hired by black market labour gangs to work on poultry farms and vegetable factories, supplying the country’s major supermarkets and fast food chains, including Yum! Brands' restaurants. Amongst the suppliers targeted was the company's direct supplier, Baiada, Australia’s largest chicken processing company. In June 2015, the Australian workplace watchdog confirmed the accusations of labour exploitation at Baiada, particularly massive overtime hours and gross underpayment. In October 2015, Baiada provided a strong response, including a promise to compensate workers and to make for future payments if they are not made by hiring contractors. The step was well received by Australia’s workplace watchdog.

The limited information on supplier compliance practices implies further operational and reputational risks.","Yum! Brands was found to have sourced from suppliers involved in labour exploitation in Australia. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), in a programme in May 2015, revealed widespread and routine abuses of migrant workers in Australia, including illegal and low pay, assault and harassment. Workers from Asia and Europe were hired by black market labour gangs to work on poultry farms and vegetable factories, supplying the country’s major supermarkets and fast food chains, including Yum! Brands' restaurants. Amongst the suppliers targeted was the company's direct supplier, Baiada, Australia’s largest chicken processing company. In June 2015, the Australian workplace watchdog confirmed the accusations of labour exploitation at Baiada, particularly massive overtime hours and gross underpayment. In October 2015, Baiada provided a strong response, including a promise to compensate workers and to make for future payments if they are not made by hiring contractors. The step was well received by Australia’s workplace watchdog.
